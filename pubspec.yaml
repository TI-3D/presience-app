  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: "InterTight"
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/InterTight-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/InterTight-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/InterTight-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        # - family: Trajan Pro
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
    #       weight: 700
